Steps to run the code
1)Install pytesseract package either using !pip intall pytesseract or by manually adding it to library
2)Then change the directory in 4th line from bottom of code in "Final.ipynb" or "Final.py" file (whichever works for you) to where you have installed the library
3)Open the code in jupyter notebook and then run the code
4)You can try different images stored in folder or even add your new ones and add their path in 5th line of code.

Thank You!!
